1. Sorted array -> binary search
2. String with limited characters -> hashMaps, e.g., one day has up to 1440 minutes
3. Word ladder -> bfs is faster than dfs, because it can cut off earlier
4. Binary search -> use Segment tree or binary index tree
5. find prefix + suffix -> find mid instead, like max subarray
